Create a new laravel app called todo, and install the api php artisan install:api
<br>Create API routes for the following things, making sure you follow the REST rules as best you can:
- Get all todos
    - Filterable by whether or not the todo is completed
- Mark a todo as complete
- Delete a todo
- Add a todo
    - It should default to uncompleted 
<p>Each todo should have a name, a description and a boolean to track whether or not the todo is completed
